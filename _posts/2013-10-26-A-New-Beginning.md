It's been a good year, our team managed to build a robot, and do fairly well in the Calgary Regional Competition. Unfortunatly, despite how good we are at building Robots, we are not so good at finding sponsors. LARRY will be dissolved.

However while this is the end of LARRY, the members of our team will be continuing on and forming two more teams, 5117 and 5118. We have yet to decide on new team names, but when we do, they will be posted here.

We hope to have a fresh start with the new team and use our experience from last year to get started out on the right foot. Or first goal is to find sponsors right away for the new teams.

As much as I hate to see the team we've worked on this year go, hopefully this will allow us to continue doing what we love, which is building robots. We'll see you at the competitions!
